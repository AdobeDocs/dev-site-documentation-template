## How to test

- To run the configured linters locally (requires [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)):

  ```shell
  yarn lint
  ```

  > NOTE If you cannot use Docker, you can install the linters separately. In `.github/super-linter.env`, see which linters are enabled, and find the tools being used for linting in [Supported Linters](https://github.com/github/super-linter#supported-linters).

- To check internal links locally

  ```shell
  yarn test:links
  ```

- To build and preview locally:

  ```shell
  yarn start
  ```

## How to deploy

For any team that wishes to deploy to the developer.adobe.com and developer-stage.adobe.com websites, they must be in contact with the dev-site team. Teams will be given a path that will follow the pattern `developer.adobe.com/{product}/`. This will allow doc developers to setup their subpaths to look something like:

```text
developer.adobe.com/{product}/docs
developer.adobe.com/{product}/community
developer.adobe.com/{product}/community/code_of_conduct
developer.adobe.com/{product}/community/contribute
```

### Launching a deploy

You can deploy using the GitHub actions deploy workflow see [deploy instructions](https://github.com/adobe/aio-theme#deploy-to-azure-storage-static-websites).
